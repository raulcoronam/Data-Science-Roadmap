# My Journey in Data Science: A Chronology of Curiosity 🚀

Hello! 👋

This repository is simply a space to document my learning journey in the world of Data Science.

The goal is to show the process of how I learn, how I explore, and how I evolve. Each folder is a stop on my roadmap, documenting not only the result but also the lessons learned along the way.

Thank you for visiting my “organized chaos.” I hope you find something interesting!
