Scientific Computing Libraries

Libraries like Pandas and NumPy provide built-in modules for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
Pandas offers data structures like Data Frames for effective data cleaning and analysis.
Visualization Libraries

Matplotlib is a widely used library for creating customizable graphs and plots.
Seaborn, built on Matplotlib, specializes in generating advanced visualizations like heat maps and violin plots.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries

Scikit-learn provides tools for statistical modeling, including regression and classification.
Keras simplifies building deep learning models, while TensorFlow and PyTorch cater to different needs in deep learning development and experimentation.

Understanding APIs

An API allows communication between different software components, enabling data exchange without needing to know the backend processes.
The API serves as the interface that users interact with, while the library contains all the program components.
REST APIs

REST APIs facilitate communication over the internet, allowing access to resources like storage and algorithms.
They operate through requests and responses, using HTTP methods and JSON files to transmit data.
Examples of APIs

The Watson Speech-to-Text API converts audio to text by sending audio files as post requests and receiving transcriptions.
The Watson Language Translator API translates text, demonstrating how APIs can perform specific tasks and return results to the client.

Definition of a Data Set

A data set is a structured collection of data, which can include text, numbers, or media.
Common formats include tabular data, such as CSV files, where each row represents an observation and each column contains specific information.
Types of Data Ownership and Sources

Traditionally, data sets were private due to proprietary information, but many organizations now share open data publicly.
Open data sources, like those from the United Nations and Kaggle, provide valuable insights for data scientists and researchers.
Community Data License Agreement (CDLA)

The CDLA facilitates the sharing of open data with two licenses: CDLA-Sharing (requires sharing modifications) and CDLA-Permissive (does not require sharing).
These licenses do not restrict the results derived from using the data, which is crucial for data science applications.
