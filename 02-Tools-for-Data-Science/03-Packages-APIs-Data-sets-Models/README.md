Scientific Computing Libraries

Libraries like Pandas and NumPy provide built-in modules for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
Pandas offers data structures like Data Frames for effective data cleaning and analysis.
Visualization Libraries

Matplotlib is a widely used library for creating customizable graphs and plots.
Seaborn, built on Matplotlib, specializes in generating advanced visualizations like heat maps and violin plots.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries

Scikit-learn provides tools for statistical modeling, including regression and classification.
Keras simplifies building deep learning models, while TensorFlow and PyTorch cater to different needs in deep learning development and experimentation.

Understanding APIs

An API allows communication between different software components, enabling data exchange without needing to know the backend processes.
The API serves as the interface that users interact with, while the library contains all the program components.
REST APIs

REST APIs facilitate communication over the internet, allowing access to resources like storage and algorithms.
They operate through requests and responses, using HTTP methods and JSON files to transmit data.
Examples of APIs

The Watson Speech-to-Text API converts audio to text by sending audio files as post requests and receiving transcriptions.
The Watson Language Translator API translates text, demonstrating how APIs can perform specific tasks and return results to the client.
