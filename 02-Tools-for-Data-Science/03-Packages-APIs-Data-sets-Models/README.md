Scientific Computing Libraries

Libraries like Pandas and NumPy provide built-in modules for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
Pandas offers data structures like Data Frames for effective data cleaning and analysis.
Visualization Libraries

Matplotlib is a widely used library for creating customizable graphs and plots.
Seaborn, built on Matplotlib, specializes in generating advanced visualizations like heat maps and violin plots.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries

Scikit-learn provides tools for statistical modeling, including regression and classification.
Keras simplifies building deep learning models, while TensorFlow and PyTorch cater to different needs in deep learning development and experimentation.

Understanding APIs

An API allows communication between different software components, enabling data exchange without needing to know the backend processes.
The API serves as the interface that users interact with, while the library contains all the program components.
REST APIs

REST APIs facilitate communication over the internet, allowing access to resources like storage and algorithms.
They operate through requests and responses, using HTTP methods and JSON files to transmit data.
Examples of APIs

The Watson Speech-to-Text API converts audio to text by sending audio files as post requests and receiving transcriptions.
The Watson Language Translator API translates text, demonstrating how APIs can perform specific tasks and return results to the client.

Definition of a Data Set

A data set is a structured collection of data, which can include text, numbers, or media.
Common formats include tabular data, such as CSV files, where each row represents an observation and each column contains specific information.
Types of Data Ownership and Sources

Traditionally, data sets were private due to proprietary information, but many organizations now share open data publicly.
Open data sources, like those from the United Nations and Kaggle, provide valuable insights for data scientists and researchers.
Community Data License Agreement (CDLA)

The CDLA facilitates the sharing of open data with two licenses: CDLA-Sharing (requires sharing modifications) and CDLA-Permissive (does not require sharing).
These licenses do not restrict the results derived from using the data, which is crucial for data science applications.

### Dataset licenses

PUBLIC DOMAIN MARK - PUBLIC DOMAIN
When a dataset has a Public Domain license, all the rights to use, access, modify and share the dataset are open to everyone. Here there is technically no license.

OPEN DATA COMMONS PUBLIC DOMAIN DEDICATION AND LICENSE – PDDL
Open Data Commons license has the same features as the Public Domain license, but the difference is the PDDL license uses a licensing mechanism to give the rights to the dataset.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL CC-BY
This license allows users to share and modify a dataset, but only if they give credit to the creator(s) of the dataset.

COMMUNITY DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT – CDLA PERMISSIVE-2.0
Like most open-source licenses, this license allows users to use, modify, adapt, and share the dataset, but only if a disclaimer of warranties and liability is also included.

OPEN DATA COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE - ODC-BY
This license allows users to share and adapt a dataset, but only if they give credit to the creator(s) of the dataset.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC-BY-SA
This license allows users to use, share, and adapt a dataset, but only if they give credit to the dataset and show any changes or transformations, they made to the dataset. Users might not want to use this license because they have to share the work they did on the dataset.

COMMUNITY DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT – CDLA-SHARING-1.0
This license uses the principle of ‘copyleft’: users can use, modify, and adapt a dataset, but only if they don’t add license restrictions on the new work(s) they create with the dataset.

OPEN DATA COMMONS OPEN DATABASE LICENSE - ODC-ODBL
This license allows users to use, share, and adapt a dataset but only if they give credit to the dataset and show any changes or transformations they make to the dataset. Users might not want to use this license because they have to share the work they did on the dataset.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-NC
This license is a restrictive license. Users can share and adapt a dataset, provided they give credit to its creator(s) and ensure that the dataset is not used for any commercial purpose.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NO DERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-ND
This license is also a restrictive license. Users can share a dataset if they give credit to its creator(s). This license does not allow additions, transformations, or changes to the dataset.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-NC-SA
This license allows users to share a dataset only if they give credit to its creator(s). Users can share additions, transformations, or changes to the dataset, but they cannot use the dataset for commercial purposes.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-NC-ND
This license allows users to share a dataset only if they give credit to its creator(s). Users are not allowed to modify the dataset and are not allowed to use it for commercial purposes.
